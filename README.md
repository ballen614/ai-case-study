# Case Study - ![Midjourney Logo](midjourney.png)

## Overview
Midjourney is an independent, privately owned research lab founded in 2021 by David Holz, a silicon valley entrepreneur.  The research lab has made a name for itself for its incredible, industry-leading images created via generative AI.  The very small organization has found tremendous success in their results, but there is certainly more to the goals of the team at Midjourney than simply generating images.  The intent of this paper is to explore the past and present of Midjourney to provide context for the future of Midjourney as stated by the founder himself on January 10th on his X account: "we can only create what we first imagine".

## Midjourney's Founder - David Holz
David Holz grew up in Fort Lauderdale Florida, living with his father who was a dentist.  His neighborhood was comprised of "mostly old people" (9), so he spent a lot of time alone with his father's computer playing video games.  His early inspiration for software engineering came from modifying the software for a Star Wars computer game called "Dark Forces II". (9)  It was during this time, in middle school, that David came up with the idea of his first start up, Leap Motion.

### David's Education
Years later, David graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, with degrees in both Math and Physics.  He followed his graduation by beginning work on his PhD in Applied Mathematics.  Also during this time, he began working as a student researcher at the Max Planck Institute and later then NASA Langley Research Center. (12)

David found his schedule of study and work to be overwhelming, and in 2010, he moved to San Francisco to start Leap Motion (9)(10)(11), the startup he had envisioned years prior while in middle school. (9)

### Leap Motion - Grand Ambitions and Hard Lessons
First envisioned in middle school, first developed in 2008, and first announced as a product in 2012, Leap Motion manufactured and marketed a computer input device that used human finger motions as input, but required no physical contact; the users hands were mapped in physical space via infrared emitters and sensors. (11)  The company was, at it's peak, valued at over $300 million dollars, but was eventually sold to Ultrahaptics for about $30 million.  

While the story of Leap Motion is largely out of the scope of this case study, it is important to note that David's experience and, arguably, failures with Leap Motion were influential in his approach when creating Midjourney:

>I was looking for a different environment instead of a big venture-backed company, and I left to start Midjourney. (10)

Also of note, David's motivation for starting Leap Motion was to solve a "big problem" for humanity: creating a way to interface with computers more quickly and get more out of the computer. (13)  This illustrates David's intent on solving fundamental human problems.  Though Leap Motion ultimately failed, it should be noted that David's idea has been embraced by the recent release of the Apple Vision Pro, a computing platform that uses no input device, instead, tracking the user's hands in space, using them for input.

## Midjourney
In June of 2020, Jonathan Ho, a Berkely researcher, [releases a paper on Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239).  This started a wave of innovations on AI-based image creation.  This industry activity inspired David Holz to start the company of Midjourney in 2021, with the first open beta launching on July 12, 2022. (3)

The mission of Midjourney as stated on their website, is: 

> \[To explore] new mediums of thought and expanding the imaginative powers of the human species.  We are a small self-funded team focused on design, human infrastructure, and AI.

### A Creative Approach to Community - A Differentiator
One of the first differentiators of Midjourney is their chosen operating environment: Midjourney users are required to interact with the service via the online chat platform, Discord.  Originally created by a game developer, and embraced by gamers, Discord is an instant messaging and VoIP social platform which allows communication through voice calls, video calls, text messaging, and media and files. Communication can be private or take place in virtual communities called "servers". (14) Midjourney is one of the many Discord servers offered on the service. 

David Holz realized through user testing that users independently seemed to lack the creativity and interest in interacting with the platform, but in a social environment like Discord, where images are generated in a social setting, people collaborate to come up with more and more imaginative images. (5) Ultimately, it's this community as a result of the use of Discord that is a major differentiator for Midjourney.

### Midjourney's Organizational Performance
While a privately held company such as Midjourney does not have to report financials, there are still some indications of their company performance, and many speculations on their revenue.  For example, Midjourney has become, by far, the largest Discord server, with around 16 million registered users and between one and 2.5 million daily active users. (15)  

When considering that an active Midjourney user is required to subscribe to a monthly plan costing between $8 a month and $96 a month \(depending on features), Midjourney is estimated to gross as much as $200 million a year, all entirely without investors.

Another measure of Midjourney's performance is 

### Landscape and Competitors
OpenAI's DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, others.

### Current Company Performance
### Legal Challenges

## Long Term Vision / Conclusion
Midjourney, as a research lab, is using Generative AI to explore what I will call Computational Creativity.  Currently, images are the vector to facilitate their research, but the end product isn't images, but imagination itself.  As stated by David himself: 
>One of my goals at Midjourney is to build new human infrastructure, and I think about \[how] the world is going to need a lot of new things and we need infrastructure on which to build new things.  I think about building new pillars of infrastructure, and my pillars were reflection, imagination, and coordination. (5)
