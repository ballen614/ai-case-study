# AI Case Study Notes

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company
	- Midjourney

* When was the company incorporated?
	- The company was founded in 2021 according to cbinsights.com.  I can't find a more specific date, yet.

* Who are the founders of the company?
	- The founder is David Holz who previously started Leap Motion (a spatial hand tracking computer interface). - Wikipedia

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
	- David Holz founded Midjourney "to expand the imaginative powers of the human species".

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
	- Midjourney is a privately owned and self-funded research lab.

## Business Activities


* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?
	- Presently, Midjourney is notable for having the best generative AI with respect to photos, though the speculation is that they intend to push the boundaries of augmented human imagination.


* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
	- Because they are a research lab of only a dozen or so people, they are not addressing a market demand in a traditional sense.  With that said, they are one of the largest consumers of Cloud CPU on the planet.


* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
	- Their current advantage has to do with the social nature of their implementation.  Midjourney's user interface is connected to a popular social chat client called Discord.  They are Discord's largest customer by far.  By having a collaborative community surrounding the creation of images, and stoking the fires of community collaboration through Discord, they are able to get leading community involvment to aid in their research, all while making a ton of money.


* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the companyâ€™s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
	- Discord, and a generative AI process called diffusion. 

## Landscape

* What field is the company in?
	- Though something of a novelty at the moment, I can see reliable generative AI as being a disruptor for stock photos and rapid prototyping of artwork in creative projects.

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years?
	- Generative art is a field that has emerged in the last 18 months, and the innovations are incredible in such a short time.

* What are the other major companies in this field?
  	- Competitors: Leonardo.AI, Craiyon, Hugging Face, Bria, Runway, Let's Enhance - Source: https://www.cbinsights.com/company/midjourney

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
	- The company is self funded, privately owned, and it is estimated that they earn more than $100M a year!  Their product is easy and quick to use, relatively inexpensive, and produces the highest quality images on the market today.  Being able to generate images to use in reports and stock art for creative productions is just the beginning of their mission of augmenting human imagination. 

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?
	- Certainly profitable income is a clear measure of success, and though Midjourney is privately held, revenue estimates put them at over $100M.  Other metrics for products of this type would be visual fidelity, a subjective measure, but important still, and speed of image generation, which Midjourney has tackled by having the image come up initially somewhat blurry, and getting clearer over time.  This seems to placate impatient users, rather than making them wait the full time with nothing happening.

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?
	- N/A


## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
	- Computational creativity is at the core of what Midjourney offers, and the application of such a product could be nearly limitless, if it works.  For example, in Information Security, attackers need to combine technical expertise with creativity to penetrate the defenses of their target, and the defenders need to think creatively to imagine all the possible ways an attacker might compromise the defenders infrastructure.  Computational creativity could be applied to software engineering, where solution to unsolved problems require creativity to solve.  Even in something like sports, computational creativity could generate entirely new football plays never thought of, for example.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
	- I believe the end goal of Midjourney is not to imagine new images, but to commodatize imagination.  If they can pull that off, things are going to get crazy.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
	- Creatity and engineering go hand in hand.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
	- see above.
